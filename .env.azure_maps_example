# Azure Maps Configuration Example
# Add these variables to your .env file for Azure Maps Search functionality

# Azure Maps Client ID (for Managed Identity authentication - PREFERRED)
# This is the client ID of your Azure Maps account's managed identity
# Get this from: Azure Portal > Azure Maps Account > Authentication > Managed Identity
AZURE_MAPS_CLIENT_ID=your-azure-maps-client-id-here

# Azure Maps Subscription Key (fallback authentication method)
# This is your Azure Maps subscription key
# Get this from: Azure Portal > Azure Maps Account > Authentication > Shared Key Authentication
AZURE_MAPS_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY=your-azure-maps-subscription-key-here

# Notes:
# 1. AZURE_MAPS_CLIENT_ID is preferred for production (uses Managed Identity)
# 2. AZURE_MAPS_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY is simpler for development/testing
# 3. If both are provided, Managed Identity (CLIENT_ID) takes precedence
# 4. At least one of these must be configured for Azure Maps to work
