# 🎯 Azure Maps 401 Error - ROOT CAUSE FOUND & FIXED

## ✅ **Problem Identified**
Your Azure Maps managed identity authentication was **missing the required `x-ms-client-id` header**!

According to Microsoft's documentation:
> "After the application receives an access token, the SDK and/or application sends an HTTPS request with the following set of required HTTP headers:
> - **x-ms-client-id**: 30d7cc…9f55 (Azure Maps account-based GUID)
> - **Authorization**: Bearer eyJ0e…HNIVN"

## 🔧 **What We Fixed**
1. **Added `x-ms-client-id` header** to all Azure Maps API calls when using managed identity
2. **Enhanced debug logging** to show when the header is added
3. **Added error messages** when the Client ID is missing

## 📋 **Required Environment Variables**
You need to set these in your Container App:
- `AZURE_MAPS_CLIENT_ID` = Your Azure Maps account unique ID (Client ID)

## 🔍 **How to Get Your Client ID**
Run this command (after selecting your subscription in Azure CLI):
```bash
python get_azure_maps_client_id.py
```

Or manually with Azure CLI:
```bash
az maps account show --name azure-maps-instance --resource-group <your-rg> --query properties.uniqueId -o tsv
```

## 🚀 **Next Steps**
1. **Get your Azure Maps Client ID** from the script above
2. **Set the environment variable** in your Container App:
   ```
   AZURE_MAPS_CLIENT_ID=<your-client-id>
   ```
3. **Restart your Container App**
4. **Test again** - the 401 errors should be resolved!

## 📊 **What We Confirmed Working**
✅ **Role Assignments**: Perfect
- Azure Maps Data Reader ✅
- Azure Maps Search and Render Data Reader ✅
- Assigned to correct managed identity (5238e629-da2f-4bb0-aea5-14d45526c864) ✅
- Correct scope (azure-maps-instance account level) ✅

✅ **Token Acquisition**: Perfect
- JWT token format ✅
- Correct audience: https://atlas.microsoft.com ✅
- Correct subject (managed identity ID) ✅
- Valid issuer ✅

❌ **Missing Header**: FIXED
- x-ms-client-id header was missing ❌ → Now added ✅

## 🎉 **Expected Result**
After setting the Client ID environment variable and restarting, your managed identity authentication should work perfectly!

The enhanced debug logging will now show:
```
🆔 Added x-ms-client-id header: <your-client-id>
```

And your 401 errors should disappear! 🎯
