```bash
# Subscription Key (recommended for development)
AZURE_MAPS_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY=your-subscription-key

# Managed Identity (recommended for production)
AZURE_MAPS_CLIENT_ID=your-managed-identity-client-id
AZURE_MAPS_ACCOUNT_NAME=your-maps-account-name
```

> **⚠️ CRITICAL: Azure Maps Managed Identity Configuration**
> 
> Unlike most Azure services, Azure Maps requires **TWO configuration steps** for managed identity authentication:
> 
> 1. **✅ Role Assignment**: Assign "Azure Maps Data Reader" role to your managed identity
> 2. **🔧 Account Configuration**: Enable Azure AD authentication on the Azure Maps account
> 
> **Common 401 Error Fix:**
> ```bash
> # Step 1: Check current authentication mode
> az maps account show --name YOUR_MAPS_ACCOUNT --resource-group YOUR_RG --query "properties.disableLocalAuth"
> 
> # Step 2: Enable Azure AD authentication (CRITICAL!)
> az maps account update --name YOUR_MAPS_ACCOUNT --resource-group YOUR_RG --sku S1 --disable-local-auth true
> 
> # Step 3: Assign role (if not already done)
> az role assignment create --assignee YOUR_MANAGED_IDENTITY_ID --role "Azure Maps Data Reader" --scope "/subscriptions/YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION/resourceGroups/YOUR_RG/providers/Microsoft.Maps/accounts/YOUR_MAPS_ACCOUNT"
> 
> # Step 4: Restart your container app
> az containerapp restart --name YOUR_CONTAINER_APP --resource-group YOUR_RG
> ```
> 
> **Why This is Required:**
> - Azure Maps accounts default to subscription key authentication only
> - Setting `--disable-local-auth true` forces the account to accept managed identity tokens
> - Without this configuration, you'll get 401 errors even with correct role assignments
> 
> **For Production Deployment:**
> - Remove or comment out `AZURE_MAPS_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY` from environment variables
> - Keep `AZURE_MAPS_CLIENT_ID` and `AZURE_MAPS_ACCOUNT_NAME` for reference
> - Ensure your Azure Container App has system-assigned managed identity enabled

- `openai.tokens.completion` - Number of output tokens  
- `openai.tokens.total` - Total tokens consumed
- `openai.model` - Model/deployment name used
- `openai.duration_ms` - Request latency in milliseconds
- `openai.cost.estimated_usd` - Estimated cost in USD
- `openai.cost.estimated_cents` - Estimated cost in cents
- `operation` - Type of operation (chat_completion, etc.)

#### 📈 Aggregated Metrics

The system records the following metrics for monitoring and alerting:

- **`openai_tokens_total`** - Counter tracking total tokens by type
  - Labels: `model`, `operation`, `token_type` (total/prompt/completion), `status`
- **`openai_token_cost_total`** - Counter tracking estimated costs in cents
  - Labels: `model`, `operation`, `status`
- **`openai_request_duration_ms`** - Histogram of request latencies
  - Labels: `model`, `operation`, `status`

#### 🤖 Automatic Instrumentation

Semantic Kernel OpenAI service calls are automatically instrumented without code changes:

```python
# This call is automatically tracked
response = await agent.get_response(messages=message, thread=thread)
```

#### Core Components

1. **`telemetry/token_tracking.py`** - Core token tracking utilities
2. **`telemetry/semantic_kernel_instrumentation.py`** - Automatic SK instrumentation
3. **`telemetry/config.py`** - Enhanced telemetry configuration
4. **`telemetry/decorators.py`** - Existing telemetry decorators

## 🚀 Deployment & CI/CD

### 🔄 Automated Version Management

The project includes sophisticated automated versioning integrated with Docker workflows:

#### Version Management Scripts

```bash
# Auto-increment minor version and build
_container_build.bat
# 1.3.0 → 1.4.0 (auto-increments minor, resets patch)
# Builds: ai-calendar-assistant:latest and ai-calendar-assistant:1.4.0

# Complete build and push pipeline  
_build_and_push.bat
# Increment → Build → Tag → Push (all automated)

# Push existing version to registry
_container_push.bat
# Pushes both latest and version-specific tags
```

#### Version Utilities

```bash
# Get current version from pyproject.toml
python version_manager.py get
# Output: 1.4.0

# Increment minor version programmatically
python version_manager.py increment  
# Updates pyproject.toml: 1.4.0 → 1.5.0
# Updates release date automatically
```

#### Benefits

- ✅ **Semantic Versioning**: Follows semver (major.minor.patch)
- ✅ **Consistent Tagging**: Python package and Docker versions stay in sync
- ✅ **Automated Release Notes**: Updates release date in pyproject.toml

### 🎯 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Create alerts and dashboards using these metrics:

| Metric | Query Pattern | Threshold |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| **Error Rate** | `countif(success == false) * 100.0 / count()` | > 5% |
| **Response Time P95** | `percentile(durationMs, 95)` | > 5000ms |
| **Model Token Usage** | `sum(toint(customDimensions.["tokens.total"]))` | Monitor trends |
| **Active Sessions** | `dcount(tostring(customDimensions.["session_id"]))` | Capacity planning |
| **API Availability** | `countif(operation_Name startswith "api." and success == true)` | > 99% |

### 💡 Pro Tips for Analytics

1. **Time Ranges**: Adjust `timeRange` variable based on your analysis needs
2. **Session Tracking**: Use your actual session ID in session-based queries  
3. **Custom Alerts**: Set up Application Insights alerts using these queries
4. **Performance Baselines**: Establish baseline metrics for comparison
5. **Cost Optimization**: Use model analytics to optimize token usage and costs

)
```

### Conversation Intelligence

The AI agent uses sophisticated prompting to handle complex scheduling scenarios:

- **Multi-step Planning**: Breaks down complex requests into manageable steps
- **Attendee Validation**: Confirms participant lists before scheduling
- **Conflict Resolution**: Automatically suggests alternative times
- **Context Awareness**: Remembers preferences and past interactions

## 🔍 Monitoring and Observability

### Application Insights Integration

Monitor your AI Calendar Assistant with comprehensive telemetry and detailed token tracking:

#### Token Usage and Cost Monitoring

**View token usage by model:**
```kusto
customMetrics
| where name == "openai_tokens_total"
| summarize TotalTokens = sum(value) by tostring(customDimensions.model), bin(timestamp, 1h)
| render timechart
```

**Track costs over time:**
```kusto
customMetrics
| where name == "openai_token_cost_total"
| summarize TotalCostCents = sum(value) by bin(timestamp, 1h)
| extend TotalCostUSD = TotalCostCents / 100
| render timechart
```

**Monitor request latency by model:**
```kusto
customMetrics
| where name == "openai_request_duration_ms"
| summarize avg(value), percentile(value, 95) by tostring(customDimensions.model), bin(timestamp, 5m)
| render timechart
```

**Find expensive requests:**
```kusto
dependencies
| where name contains "openai"
| where customDimensions.["openai.cost.estimated_usd"] > 0.01  // Requests over 1 cent
| project timestamp, customDimensions.["openai.model"], customDimensions.["openai.tokens.total"], customDimensions.["openai.cost.estimated_usd"]
| order by timestamp desc
```

**Token usage breakdown by operation type:**
```kusto
customMetrics
| where name == "openai_tokens_total"
| summarize TotalTokens = sum(value) by tostring(customDimensions.operation), tostring(customDimensions.token_type)
| render piechart
```

#### Performance Monitoring

**API performance trends:**
```kusto
requests
| where name == "POST /agent_chat"
| summarize avg(duration), percentile(duration, 95) by bin(timestamp, 5m)
| render timechart
```

**Error rate monitoring:**
```kusto
requests
| summarize ErrorRate = 100.0 * countif(success == false) / count() by bin(timestamp, 5m)
| render timechart
```

#### Setting Up Alerts

Create alerts in Azure Monitor for:

1. **High Token Usage**: Alert when hourly token usage exceeds threshold
   ```kusto
   customMetrics
   | where name == "openai_tokens_total"
   | summarize TotalTokens = sum(value) by bin(timestamp, 1h)
   | where TotalTokens > 100000  // Adjust threshold as needed
   ```

2. **Cost Monitoring**: Alert when daily costs exceed budget
   ```kusto
   customMetrics
   | where name == "openai_token_cost_total"
   | summarize DailyCostUSD = sum(value) / 100 by bin(timestamp, 1d)
   | where DailyCostUSD > 50  // Adjust budget threshold
   ```

3. **Error Rates**: Alert on high failure rates for OpenAI calls
   ```kusto
   dependencies
   | where name contains "openai"
   | summarize ErrorRate = 100.0 * countif(success == false) / count() by bin(timestamp, 5m)
   | where ErrorRate > 5  // Alert if error rate > 5%
   ```

4. **Latency Issues**: Alert when 95th percentile latency is too high
   ```kusto
   customMetrics
   | where name == "openai_request_duration_ms"
   | summarize P95Latency = percentile(value, 95) by bin(timestamp, 5m)
   | where P95Latency > 5000  // Alert if P95 > 5 seconds
   ```

#### Redis Cache Monitoring

**Monitor Redis cache operations and performance:**

**Find all Redis operations:**
```kusto
requests
| where operation_Name in ("redis_connect", "cache_get", "cache_set", "cache_wrapper", "cache_close")
| where cloud_RoleName == "ai-calendar-assistant"
| order by timestamp desc
```

**Monitor get_all_users cache performance:**
```kusto
requests  
| where operation_Name == "get_all_users"
| where cloud_RoleName == "ai-calendar-assistant"
| order by timestamp desc
| project timestamp, duration, operation_Name, customDimensions
```

**Find cache hit/miss patterns:**
```kusto
traces
| where message contains "Cache" or message contains "Redis"
| where cloud_RoleName == "ai-calendar-assistant" 
| order by timestamp desc
```

**Cache performance comparison (before/after caching):**
```kusto
requests
| where operation_Name == "get_all_users"
| where cloud_RoleName == "ai-calendar-assistant"
| summarize AvgDuration = avg(duration), Count = count() by bin(timestamp, 1h)
| render timechart
```

**Redis connection health:**
```kusto
requests
| where operation_Name == "redis_connect"
| summarize SuccessRate = 100.0 * countif(success == true) / count() by bin(timestamp, 5m)
| render timechart
```

**Redis telemetry events:**
```kusto
customEvents
| where name in ("redis_connection_attempt", "redis_connection_success", "redis_connection_failed", "redis_status_initialized", "redis_connection_closing", "redis_connection_closed", "redis_connection_close_failed")
| where cloud_RoleName == "ai-calendar-assistant"
| order by timestamp desc
| project timestamp, name, customDimensions
```

**Redis connection success rate:**
```kusto
customEvents
| where name in ("redis_connection_success", "redis_connection_failed") 
| where cloud_RoleName == "ai-calendar-assistant"
| summarize SuccessRate = 100.0 * countif(name == "redis_connection_success") / count() by bin(timestamp, 15m)
| render timechart
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Authentication Failures**
```bash
# Verify Azure CLI authentication
az account show

# Check application permissions
az ad app permission list --id your-app-id
```

**Azure Maps 401 Errors**

*"Unauthorized" errors from Azure Maps API:*
1. **Check Account Configuration**: Azure Maps requires special managed identity setup
   ```bash
   # Check if local auth is disabled (should be true for managed identity)
   az maps account show --name YOUR_MAPS_ACCOUNT --resource-group YOUR_RG --query "properties.disableLocalAuth"
   ```

2. **Enable Azure AD Authentication**: This is the most common fix
   ```bash
   # Enable managed identity authentication (replace S1 with your SKU)
   az maps account update --name YOUR_MAPS_ACCOUNT --resource-group YOUR_RG --sku S1 --disable-local-auth true
   ```

3. **Verify Role Assignment**: Ensure managed identity has proper permissions
   ```bash
   # List current role assignments
   az role assignment list --assignee YOUR_MANAGED_IDENTITY_ID --all --output table
   
   # Should include "Azure Maps Data Reader" role
   ```

4. **Restart Container App**: Required after configuration changes
   ```bash
   az containerapp restart --name YOUR_CONTAINER_APP --resource-group YOUR_RG
   ```

*Environment Configuration Issues:*
- Ensure `AZURE_MAPS_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY` is commented out for production
- Verify `AZURE_MAPS_ACCOUNT_NAME` matches your actual Azure Maps account name
- Check that managed identity is enabled on your Container App

**Token Tracking Issues**

*Token Information Not Appearing:*
1. **Check Semantic Kernel Version**: Ensure you're using a compatible version
2. **Verify Response Structure**: Token usage might be in different response attributes
3. **Enable Debug Logging**: Set log level to DEBUG to see extraction attempts
4. **Verify Application Insights**: Ensure `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` is set
5. **Check Telemetry Initialization**: Ensure `initialize_telemetry()` returns `True`

*Cost Calculations Seem Wrong:*
1. **Update Pricing**: Check if pricing models in `TOKEN_PRICING` are current
2. **Model Mapping**: Ensure your deployment name maps to the correct pricing model
3. **Token Extraction**: Verify token counts are being extracted correctly

*Missing Metrics in Application Insights:*
1. **Connection String**: Verify `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` is set correctly
2. **Telemetry Initialization**: Ensure telemetry is properly initialized in your application
3. **Buffering**: Metrics may take a few minutes to appear in Application Insights
4. **Network Connectivity**: Check if your application can reach Application Insights endpoints

**Graph API Errors**
- Confirm application has required Microsoft Graph permissions
- Verify tenant ID and client credentials
- Check user exists in the organization

**CosmosDB Connection Issues**
- Validate endpoint URL and authentication method
- Ensure proper RBAC permissions or connection string
- Check network connectivity and firewall rules
